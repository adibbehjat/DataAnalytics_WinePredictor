                    <h3>Acidity</h3>
                    <p>Acids are major wine constituents and contribute greatly to its taste.  In fact, acids impart the sourness or tartness that is a fundamental feature in wine taste.  Wines lacking in acid are "flat."  Chemically the acids influence titrable acidity which affects taste and pH which affects  color, stability to oxidation, and consequantly the overall lifespan of a wine.  The most abundant of these acids arise in the grapes themselves and carry over into the wine.  However, there are also some acids that arise as a result of the fermentation process from either yeast and/or bacteria.</p>

                    <h3>Alcohol</h3>
                    <p>In chemistry, an alcohol is any organic compound in which the hydroxyl functional group (–OH) is bound to a saturated carbon atom. The term alcohol originally referred to the primary alcohol ethanol (ethyl alcohol), the predominant alcohol in alcoholic beverages.</p>

                    <h3>Chloride</h3>
                    <p>Chloride is a common component found in table salt. The level of chloride and sodium ions in wines essentially depends on the geographic, geologic and climatic conditions of vine culture. As a general rule, the levels of these ions are low. the content of these elements is increased in wines coming from vineyards which are near the sea coast, which have brackish sub—soil or which have arid ground irrigated with salt water.</p>

                    <h3>Citric Acid</h3>
                    <p>Citric acid is a weak organic acid, which is often used as a natural preservative or additive to food or drink to add a sour taste to food. It can also be used to neutralize surfaces that have been treated with basic substances. Citric acid elicits antimicrobial activity against some molds and bacteria. It may create a relationship with antioxidants by chelating metal ions to help prevent browning. Citric acid occurs in the metabolism of almost every organism because it is an important intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle aka citric acid cycle).</p>
                    <p>Increasing citric acid concentrations will generally increase concentration of diacetyl. In winemaking, the citric-sugar co-metabolism can also increase the formation of volatile acid in wine which can affect the wine aroma negatively if present at excessive levels. Citric acid addition will affect the titratable acidity, and since some yeasts are capable of metabolizing citric acid, unexpected changes in the concentration of diacetyl and TA could result.</p>
                    <p>Citric acid is often added to wines to increase acidity, complement a specific flavor or prevent ferric hazes. It can be added to finished wines to increase acidity and give a “fresh” flavor. The disadvantage of adding citric acid is its microbial instability. Since bacteria use citric acid in their metabolism, it may increase the growth of unwanted microbes. Often to increase acidity of wine, winemakers will add tartaric acid instead.</p>

                    <h3>Density</h3>
                    <p>Density is defined as the mass, or weight, per volume of a material. In the case of liquids, density is often measured in units of g/mL, which is the weight in grams (g) of each milliliter (mL) of liquid. The density of wine is primarily determined by the concentration of alcohol, sugar, glycerol, and other dissolved solids.</p>

                    <h3>Fixed Acidity (Non-Volatile Acidity)</h3>
                    <p>The predominant fixed acids found in wines are tartaric, malic, citric, and succinic. All of these acids originate in grapes with the exception of succinic acid, which is produced by yeast during the fermentation process. Grapes also contain ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), but this is lost during fermentation.</p>
                    <p>Wines produced from cool climate grapes are high in acidity and thus taste sour. These high-acid wines can be treated to reduce the acidity, either by neutralizing agents, or by malo-lactic fermentation. Warm climate grapes can be low in acid, more or less depending on variety. In these areas tartaric acid, recycled from winemaking, is added to increase acidity and prevent wines from being flat.</p>

                    <h3>pH</h3>
                    <p>Potential of hydrogen, or pH, is a numeric scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. It is approximately the negative of the base 10 logarithm of the molar concentration, measured in units of moles per liter, of hydrogen ions. More precisely it is the negative of the logarithm to base 10 of the activity of the hydrogen ion. Solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. Pure water is neutral, at pH 7, being neither an acid nor a base. Contrary to popular belief, the pH value can be less than 0 or greater than 14 for very strong acids and bases respectively.</p>

                    <h3>Residual Sugar</h3>
                    <p>Among the components influencing how sweet a wine will taste is residual sugar. It is usually measured in grams of sugar per litre of wine, often abbreviated to g/l or g/L. Residual sugar typically refers to the sugar remaining after fermentation stops, or is stopped, but it can also result from the addition of unfermented must or ordinary table sugar. Even among the driest wines, it is rare to find wines with a level of less than 1 g/L, due to the unfermentability of certain types of sugars, such as pentose.</p>
                    <p>How sweet a wine will taste is also controlled by factors such as the acidity and alcohol levels, the amount of tannin present, and whether the wine is sparkling or not. A sweet wine can actually taste dry due to the high level of acidity. A dry wine can taste sweet if the alcohol level is elevated.</p>

                    <h3>Sulfur Dioxide</h3>
                    <p>Sulfites or sulfur dioxide is a fruit preservative widely used in dried fruits as well as wine. It is also produced by the human body at the level of about 1000 mg (milligrams) per day. Consumption of food preserved with sulfites is generally not a problem except for a few people who are deficient in the natural enzyme to break it down. All wines contain sulfites. Yeast naturally produce sulfites during fermentation so there is only a rare wine which contains none.</p>
                    <p>Sulfur dioxide plays two important roles. Firstly, it is an anti-microbial agent, and as such is used to help curtail the growth of undesirable fault producing yeasts and bacteria. Secondly, it acts as an antioxidant, safeguarding the wine's fruit integrity and protecting it against browning. Despite its chemical simplicity, SO2 can take on a few different forms in a wine. One form is called 'molecular SO2'. When in this form, it is around 500 times more effective in killing wine microbes than when in any of the other forms that it can take.</p>
                    <p>Only a proportion of the SO2 added to a wine will be effective as an anti-oxidant. The rest will combine with other elements in the wine and cease to be useful. The part lost into the wine is said to be bound, the active part to be free.</p>

                    <h3>Sulphates</h3>
                    <p>Sulphates are chemical derivates from Sulfur Dioxide that serve as a preservation agent for wines. Sulphates eliminate the presence of oxygen dependent bacterias in the wine. The process helps reduce volatile acidity of the wine, and making it more aromatically pleasant.</p>

                    <h3>Volatile Acidity</h3>
                    <p>Volatile acidity refers to the steam distillable acids present in wine, primarily acetic acid but also lactic, formic, butyric, and propionic acids. The aroma threshold for acetic acid in red wine varies from 600 mg/L and 900 mg/L, depending on the variety and style. While acetic acid is generally considered a spoilage product (vinegar), some winemakers seek a low or barely detectible level of acetic acid to add to the perceived complexity of a wine. In addition, the production of acetic acid will result in the concomitant formation of other, sometimes unpleasant, aroma compounds.</p>
                    <p>Acetic acid bacteria require oxygen to grow, therefore, elimination of any air in wine containers and sulfur dioxide, or sulphates, addition will limit their growth. Likewise, rejection of moldy grapes will prevent possible problems.</p>
